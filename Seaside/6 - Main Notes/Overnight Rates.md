## How the Overnight Rate Works

The amount of money a bank has fluctuates daily based on its lending activities and its customers' withdrawal and deposit activity. A bank may experience a shortage or surplus of cash at the end of the [business day](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-day.asp).

Those banks that experience a surplus often lend money overnight to banks that experience a shortage of funds so as to maintain their [reserve requirements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp). The requirements ensure that the banking system remains stable and liquid.

The overnight rate provides an efficient method for banks to access short-term financing from central bank depositories.

The higher the overnight rate, the more expensive it is to borrow money.

Highest interest rates makes money more expensive, because borrowing is more costly. When less money is making its way into the economy, investors tend to be more careful and are less likely to pour money into risky assets such as tech stocks and, you guessed it, crypto. 

Inversely, when interest rate are low, and borrowing become cheaper, it encourages business and consumers to borrow and spend more.

with more money in the economy and more people being employed, more money tends to find itself flowing into riskier assets.
