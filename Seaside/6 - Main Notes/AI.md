if you want to change the chart just say

from the five key visualization you suggested, change the second visualization metric to pie chart



ðŸ‘‰ Prompt 1 This is the structure of my sales data in JSON format. Understand the structure and suggest five key data visualization metrics that would be the best fit to create an interactive sales dashboard. Also explain why we should use each one? 

ðŸ‘‰ Prompt 2 Now, I want you to create an interactive sales performance dashboard with the five key visualizations using HTML and JavaScript. Use the latest version of Plotly.js CDN and include an upload feature so that we can upload the JSON file. It should generate the dashboard based on the uploaded data. Note: I need to upload the sales data from my local computer, and it should create the dashboard based on that data. 

ðŸ‘‰ Prompt 3 Provide this as an HTML downloadable file?
