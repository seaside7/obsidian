1910 US government create National Monetary Commission

the fed is central bank of the US, responsible for providing financial services to financial institution, supervising commercial banks and contributing to monetary policy. 

his role from the congress is to support the goals of maximum employment, and stable prices, this referred to as fed's dual mandate

Price stability essentially means the fed is targeting a 2% inflation rate over the medium term, to provide confidence for the people to spend and invest

Maximum employment means achieving the highest amount of employment the economy can sustainably support

these means the fed must balance these two objectives :
 ensuring there are as many jobs as possible for everyone while keeping inflation low

the branch of the fed which is responsible for setting monetary policy is the Federal Open Market Committee, aka the FOMC.

1. the FOMC reviews economic data during regularly scheduled meetings and forecast the growth of the economy, based on how economy is doing, one of the main things that the FOMC decides on is the new target for the **Federal Funds Rate** which is the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight loans
