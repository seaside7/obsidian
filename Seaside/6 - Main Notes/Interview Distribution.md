## 🧩 What does Distribusion do? (Simple explanation)

Distribusion Technologies GmbH is a **B2B travel technology company** that helps **ground transportation providers** (buses, trains, ferries) **sell their tickets digitally** across many global distribution channels.

In short:

> **Distribusion connects transport operators to the world’s travel platforms via APIs.**

---

## 🏗️ The core problem they solve

Many bus / rail / ferry operators:

- Still use **legacy systems**
    
- Don’t have modern APIs
    
- Can’t easily sell tickets on platforms like:
    
    - Booking.com
        
    - Expedia
        
    - Trainline
        
    - Omio
        
    - Corporate travel tools
        

Distribusion acts as a **technical bridge**.

## 🔌 How their platform works (important for TPM role)

### 1️⃣ Supply side (operators)

- Bus, rail, ferry companies connect **once** to Distribusion
    
- Distribusion handles:
    
    - Inventory
        
    - Pricing
        
    - Schedules
        
    - Availability
        
    - Ticketing rules

are the suppliers is using their system or using distribution supply system? like reddoorz 

### 2️⃣ Distribusion API (the core product)

- Normalizes **many different transport systems** into **one unified API**
    
- Handles:
    
    - Real-time availability
        
    - Booking & ticket issuance
        
    - Cancellations & changes
        
    - Settlement & reporting
        

This is where **API integrations & technical product management** are critical.

### 3️⃣ Demand side (partners)

- Online travel agencies (OTAs)
    
- Meta-search engines
    
- Corporate travel platforms
    
- Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) apps
    

They integrate **once** and get access to **hundreds of transport providers globally**.

## 💼 How Distribusion makes money

Primarily:

- **Commission per ticket sold**
    
- B2B platform fees
    
- Enterprise partnerships
    

No consumer app — they are **pure B2B infrastructure**.

---

## 🌍 Why they are strong as a business

You can safely say:

- Global footprint (Europe, LATAM, Asia)
    
- Strong network effects (more operators ↔ more channels)
    
- Mission-critical APIs (downtime = lost revenue)
    
- High switching costs once integrated
    
- Clear focus on **scalable platform architecture**
    

---

## 🎯 Why YOUR background fits (talking point)

This aligns perfectly with your experience in:

- API platforms (Finantier)
    
- Complex integrations
    
- Data-heavy systems
    
- Multi-stakeholder environments
    
- Technical + product bridge roles
    

You can say something like:

> “Distribusion reminds me of large-scale platform products I’ve worked on, where the main challenge is standardizing complex systems into reliable APIs that many partners depend on.”

# 1️⃣ RedDoorz — API integrations with multiple OTAs

_(Travel distribution story → very relevant to Distribusion)_

### How to frame it (30–60 seconds)

> At **RedDoorz**, I owned product strategy and delivery for integrations between our internal systems and multiple OTA partners such as **Traveloka**, **Booking.com**, and **tiket.com**.
> 
> Each partner had different API capabilities, data models, and operational constraints. My role was to define a standardized internal contract for inventory, pricing, availability, and booking flows, while allowing partner-specific adaptations without fragmenting the core platform.

### Go slightly deeper (if they ask “how?”)

**Key challenges you handled:**

- Different OTA expectations for:
    
    - Availability updates
        
    - Pricing rules
        
    - Cancellation / refund logic
        
- Rate limits & sync frequency
    
- Inconsistent error handling
    

**Your approach (TPM-style):**

> I worked with engineering to define a stable internal API contract and treated each OTA as a “channel adapter” rather than a custom build. We prioritized backward compatibility, clear versioning, and operational visibility so issues could be diagnosed quickly without breaking other integrations.


# 2️⃣ Finantier — Credit scoring platform for many fintech clients

_(API + data platform story → shows depth)_

### How to frame it (30–60 seconds)

> At **Finantier**, I led the product development of a credit scoring platform that served multiple fintech and lending partners. The system consumed transaction-level data from different sources and transformed it into standardized risk and behavioral signals that clients could integrate via APIs.

### What makes this relevant

- Multi-tenant platform
    
- Data normalization
    
- External consumers depending on your API

### The real TPM value you add (important)

**Core problem you solved:**

- Every fintech wanted:
    
    - Different scoring logic
        
    - Different thresholds
        
    - Different data visibility
        

**Your product decision:**

> Instead of building custom scoring logic per client, we created a configurable scoring framework with a shared core model and client-specific parameters. This allowed us to scale integrations without increasing operational complexity or technical debt.

That sentence alone is **gold** for a platform interview.


# 3️⃣ How to connect BOTH stories to Distribusion (say this explicitly)

If they ask _“How does your past experience relate to this role?”_, use this:

> What excites me about Distribusion is that the core challenge is very familiar to me: connecting many external partners through a stable, well-designed API while managing complexity behind the scenes. At RedDoorz, this was OTAs; at Finantier, fintech clients. The domain is different, but the product and platform problems are fundamentally the same.


## What is API fragmentation? (simple definition)

**API fragmentation** happens when an API loses its consistency because **too many special cases, custom behaviors, or incompatible versions** are added over time.


## 🧠 What Cuong will likely ask you

Be ready for:

- Why Distribusion?
    
- Experience with APIs / integrations
    
- Working with external partners
    
- Handling trade-offs between flexibility vs standardization
    
- Technical communication with engineers

## ✅ Next step (I recommend)

If you want, next I can:

- Draft **your answer to “Why Distribusion?”**
    
- Prepare **API-integration interview questions**
    
- Simulate the **30-minute call** (realistic)
    
- Help you prepare **questions to ask Cuong** (very important)
    

Just tell me what you want to prepare next 👌
