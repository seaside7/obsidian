build error
Issue  

- Build failed previously due to strict Next/Image domain checks and inconsistent API URL resolution (fallback to a staging URL when env was absent).

Fix  

- Allowed remote images in next.config.mjs so Next/Image no longer blocks the build.
- Exposed NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL from environment only; removed the hardcoded staging fallback.
- Centralized URL resolution in getApiBaseUrl() so all fetchers use the same env-based base URL and log clearly if itâ€™s missing. (this code is in src/service/api.js
