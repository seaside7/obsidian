 the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, device, people and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation



 So, what do security analysts do? Security analysts are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems. Now, we'll discuss three primary responsibilities of a security analyst, starting with protecting computer and network systems. Protecting computer and network systems requires an analyst to monitor an organization's internal network.


**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

**Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

**Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

**Security posture** is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

A **threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

An **internal threat** can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor _intentionally_ engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

**Network security** is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

**Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

**Programming** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
    
- Reviewing web traffic 
    
- Alerting suspicious activity



 Security professionals use SIEM tools to identify and analyze security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. For example, a SIEM tool may alert you that an unknown user has accessed the system. In the event of an unknown user accessing the system, you may use computer forensics to investigate the incident.

[SIEM](https://www.google.com/search?q=SIEM&oq=what+is+siem+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEAAYgAQyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDM0NTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&ved=2ahUKEwja8-uSj9CRAxUw2DgGHQTAFmQQgK4QegYIAAgAEAU) (Security Information and Event Management) in cybersecurity is ==a solution that collects, analyzes, and manages security data from across an organization's IT environment in real-time, providing a centralized view to detect, investigate, and respond to threats faster, ensuring better visibility and compliance==.


 Personally identifiable information, known as PII, is any information used to infer an individual's identity. PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information. Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as SPII, is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition.

 ## Phishing

**Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
    
- **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
    
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
    
- **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    

## Malware

**Malware** is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- **Viruses:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
    
- **Worms:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
    
- **Ransomware:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 
    
- **Spyware:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.
    

## Social Engineering 

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **Social media phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
    
- **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    
- **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 
    
- **Physical social engineering:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
    

### **Social engineering principles** 

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 
    
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 
    
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 
    
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 
    
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
    
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited _over time_. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
    
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.
    

## Key takeaways

In this reading, you learned about some common attacks and their impacts. You also learned about social engineering and why it’s so successful. While this is only a brief introduction to attack types, you will have many opportunities throughout the program to further develop your understanding of how to identify and defend against cybersecurity attacks.


Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) security domains.



![[Pasted image 20260115180335.png]]


1. Security and risk management focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law. For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

2. Asset security. This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. When working with this domain, security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.

3. Security architecture and engineering.
     This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall. A firewall is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic.
4. Communication and network security
      This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization. Imagine discovering that users are connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots. This could leave the organization and its employees vulnerable to attacks. To ensure communications are secure, you would create a network policy to prevent and mitigate exposure.
5. Identity and access management
		 Identity and access management focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications. Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings
6. Security assessment and testing
		 This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access.
7. Security operations
		This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.
8.  Software development security
		This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

## Attack types

Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

### **Supply-chain attack**

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

### **Cryptographic attack**

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- Birthday
    
- Collision
    
- Downgrade
    

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Key takeaways

The eight CISSP security domains can help an organization and its security team fortify against and prepare for a data breach. Data breaches range from simple to complex and fall under one or more domains. Note that the methods of attack discussed are only a few of many. These and other types of attacks will be discussed throughout the certificate program.



## Threat actor types

### **Advanced persistent threats**

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
    
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents
    

### **Insider threats**

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

- Sabotage
    
- Corruption
    
- Espionage
    
- Unauthorized data access or leaks 
    

### **Hacktivists**

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

- Demonstrations
    
- Propaganda
    
- Social change campaigns
    
- Fame


A **hacker** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
    
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
    
- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
