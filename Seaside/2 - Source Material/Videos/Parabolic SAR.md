As you can see the parabolic essays are indicators a series of dots placed either above or below the

price when the DOTs are below the price candles.

This means we're in an uptrend and vice versa when the DOTs are above the candles we're in a downtrend.

The best thing is that this indicator works perfectly well with the moving average crossover strategy

you've learned in the previous lessons using the EMEA crossover in the parabolic SDR together will give

you more confidence when analyzing the market trend.

Why.

Because if the EMEA crossover strategy shows an up turn signal the parabolic SDR should also show the same signal.

So in summary we'll buy a coin when the dots move from above to below the candles.

And when the moving averages show an up trend signal and on the other hand we'll consider selling our coin when the dots move from below to above the candles.

And when the moving averages show a downtrend signal OK.

First of all we had that EMJ 20 above the EMEA 9 and both lines were sloping down.

The EMEA 50 was above the red and blue lines.

The price was below these moving averages.

So we can easily predict that this was a strong downtrend.

  
Now we have an additional downtrend signal the parabolic dots were above the price bars so we could be more confident that the price would continue to drop.


### False Signal

As you can see on that chart we had a false signal here.

The dots move from above to below the price bars.

This gave us a false uptrend signal.

Why.

It's because the overall trend was still going down.

And that's also the reason why I keep telling you that when using this indicator you must look at the overall market trend to avoid false signals as you can see we had another uptrend signal here.


## another false signal

this should be downtrend but parabolic said different, So **I want you** to take note of this when you find that the dots keep staying below the price bars in form a dotted line that is sloping up while we're in a downtrend. We can predict that the trend will reverse soon meaning the downtrend is going to end soon and the price will start going back up the trend reversed when the dots moved from above to below the candles that EMA nine crossed above the EMA 20 and both lines were sloping up so we could easily predict that the price was going to rise soon.

strong signal, dot about the line, and blue line cross redline, and price below the EMA 50

Now let's have a look at another example.

We had an uptrend signal here the blue line crossed above the red line and both lines were sloping up.

The dots moved from above to below the candles that IIM-A 50 was below that EMJ nine and EMA 20.

The price was also above all of the moving averages.

So we could consider this a strong uptrend.
