MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence

It's a trend following indicator that shows you the relationship between two exponential moving averages for trading crypto currencies.

We'll use the nine day EMA in the 50 day EMA when using this indicator.

There are three important lines that you'll need to take into account the MACD line the signal line, and the zero line by looking at these lines you can easily spot incoming market trends.

1. The first line is the MACD line.

   It's calculated by subtracting the 50 day EMA from the nine day EMA.

	It's simply the difference between that EMA 9 and that EMA 50
	
2. Signal Line:  after the MACD is calculated the nine day EMA of the MACD  line is then plotted with the indicator to act as a signal line or a trigger for buy and sell signals in the final line is the zero line.

3. Zero Line: The zero line is simply a line that separates positive and negative values within the oscillator and the good news is you won't have to do any calculations. Most trading tools will help you with that

Easy right.

If you've mastered how to use the exponential moving averages this strategy is exactly the same.

But the interesting thing is the MACD can show faster buy and sell signals and the second strategy is

the MACD line crossing above or below the 0 line. When the MACD line crosses above the zero line. This shows us a stronger uptrend signal.

Do you know why it's because most of the time when the MACD line is above the zero line that EMA 9 is likely above the EMA 50.

This shows us a stronger uptrend signal because that EMA 50 can act as a dynamic support that helps push the price up and vice versa.

When the MACD line crosses below the zero line.

This shows us a stronger downtrend signal because in this case the EMA 9 is likely below that EMA 50 so that EMA 50 can act as a dynamic resistance that prevents the price from rising up.

the blue line is MACD line, the orange line is signal line, the zero line is zero line

![[Pasted image 20240710145426.png]]

the MACD line is cross over the signal line, and both line is slooping up, this will tell us the downtrend would end soon, and the price will was going to back up shortly

**AND THEN**

the trend reverse when EMA 9 cross above the EMA 20, then the signal is stronger when MACD line cross above the zero line. Remember, when MACD line is cross above the zero line, the EMA 9 is likely above the EMA 50, this is the **stronger uptrend signal**, because the EMA 50 can act as a dynamic support that help push the price up.

**IMPORTANT**

USE MACD INDICATOR AS A WAY TO IDENTIFY TREND REVERSAL, NOT A WAY TO DETERMINE WHEN TO BUY OR SELL YOUR COIN, BECAUSE ITS LIKE PARABOLIC SAR, CAN SHOW FALSE SIGNAL IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT PROPERLY, FOR EXAMPLE:

![[Pasted image 20240710150043.png]]

macd line is cross below the signal line, several time, but the trend was still going up, because overall trend is still going up, the EMA 9 is above the EMA 20 and the EMA 50, and also we have support level

![[Pasted image 20240710150226.png]]

the trend can only reverse when the price breakdown to this support level, so to avoid this false signal, you need to use MACD and EMA.


and then

![[Pasted image 20240710153011.png]]

the macd line is cross below the signal line again, and both line start slopping down, by this time the EMA 9 is cross below the EMA 20, we can easily predict the price will going to drop soon, apalagi nembus support level dan MACD line is cross below the zero line


another case:
![[Pasted image 20240710154804.png]]

the macd line is cross above the signal line, and EMA 9 cross above EMA 20,

and stronger signal here,
![[Pasted image 20240710155045.png]]

when MACD is cross above the zero line

after that,

![[Pasted image 20240710155125.png]]

it creates new resistance, support become resistance, because price cant broke up the line, prevented the price is rising up, in this case, we should wait for several days for price could break up resistance level, if it couldnt, it is likely the price will reverse
