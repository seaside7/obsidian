## 1️⃣ _Please share a brief example of a complex product or system you helped deliver_

> I helped deliver the WWF Network Data Hub, a global data platform aggregating annual datasets from more than 70 national organizations and partners worldwide. The system combined GIS-based visualization, complex data pipelines, and backend services built with Python to process, normalize, and validate large, heterogeneous datasets. The platform required close coordination between data engineering, geospatial mapping, and frontend visualization to ensure accuracy, performance, and usability for global stakeholders.

## 2️⃣ _Please share a difficult prioritization or tradeoff you owned_

> At RedDoorz, I faced a prioritization tradeoff between building new feature initiatives and stabilizing core systems that supported daily operations. Given limited engineering capacity, I chose to delay several feature requests in order to focus on improving system reliability and performance, which had a direct impact on operational efficiency. While this decision slowed short-term feature delivery, it reduced incidents and enabled the team to scale more sustainably.

_(If you want this tied to Manuva instead, I can rewrite it instantly.)_

---

## 3️⃣ _Please share a situation where technical or execution constraints forced a change in plan_

> During the development of a data-intensive platform, technical constraints around data quality and inconsistent input formats across multiple sources forced a change in the original delivery plan. Instead of launching all features at once, we phased the rollout and introduced additional validation and preprocessing layers. This adjustment ensured data accuracy and system stability, even though it extended the initial timeline.



## 1️⃣ “What challenges do you expect in this role?”

_(This is a very likely question)_

**Strong, senior answer:**

> From what I understand, Distribusion already operates a mature, production-scale API platform. The main challenges are likely around scaling integrations across many transport operators with very different legacy systems, while maintaining a consistent and reliable API for partners. Another challenge is balancing standardization versus flexibility—deciding what belongs in the core API versus operator-specific extensions—without slowing down onboarding or breaking existing integrations.

Why this works:

- Shows you understand **platform maturity**
    
- Mentions **integration complexity**
    
- Uses **TPM vocabulary** (standardization, backward compatibility)
    

---

## 2️⃣ “How would you approach API standardization vs flexibility?”

**Interview-ready answer:**

> I usually start by identifying the stable common denominator across partners and making that part of the core contract. For edge cases or operator-specific behavior, I prefer well-documented extensions or configuration-based approaches rather than one-off logic. From a product perspective, my role is to make these trade-offs explicit, communicate them clearly to partners, and work closely with engineering to avoid long-term API fragmentation.

This directly matches Distribusion’s problem space.

---

## 3️⃣ “How do you work with engineers as a Technical PM?”

**Good TPM answer:**

> I see my role as translating business and partner needs into clear technical problems. I focus on defining constraints, success metrics, and trade-offs early, while letting engineers own the implementation. Especially for APIs, I spend a lot of time on contracts, edge cases, versioning, and migration paths to reduce surprises later.

---

## 4️⃣ “Why Distribusion?” (you WILL get this)

Use this structure (don’t memorize word-for-word):

> Distribusion stands out to me as a true infrastructure platform. I’m drawn to products where APIs are the core business, not just an implementation detail. The challenges around large-scale integrations, data consistency, and reliability across global partners are very similar to platforms I’ve worked on before, just in a different domain. I’m excited by the opportunity to work on a system that directly enables global mobility at scale.

Mention **Distribusion Technologies GmbH** naturally once if needed.

## 5️⃣ Questions YOU should ask Cuong (very important)

Ask **2–3 of these**, not all.

### 🔹 Platform & role clarity

- “What are the biggest API or integration challenges the team is currently facing?”
    
- “What does success look like for this role in the first 6 months?”
    

### 🔹 Product & engineering collaboration

- “How do Product and Engineering typically collaborate on API design decisions?”
    
- “How are breaking changes and API versioning handled today?”
    

### 🔹 Scale & growth

- “Is the focus more on onboarding new transport operators, or deepening integrations with existing partners?”
    
- “What are the main constraints today: technical, organizational, or partner-driven?”
    

These questions signal **platform maturity thinking**, not job-seeking desperation.

## 6️⃣ 30-minute call structure (use this mentally)

- **0–5 min**: Intro, background
    
- **5–15 min**: Role, platform, challenges
    
- **15–25 min**: Your experience + discussion
    
- **25–30 min**: Your questions + next steps
    

If time is short → ask **“What does success look like in 6 months?”**



Reason for leaving:

## **Manuva — VP Product & Technology**

Left due to uncertainty around the company’s long-term business strategy and future direction, and to seek an environment with clearer vision and sustainable growth plans.


## **Finantier — Head of Product**

**Reason for leaving:**  
Left as the open banking initiative was introduced ahead of Indonesia’s regulatory and ecosystem readiness, making full implementation challenging at that time.

---

## **RedDoorz — Head of Product**

**Reason for leaving:**  
Left to pursue a promising opportunity in fintech focused on open banking, which aligned with my interest in emerging financial technology and long-term career growth.

---

## **Payfazz — Head of Product**

**Reason for leaving:**  
Left due to business contraction during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to team downsizing, declining GMV, and the suspension of several product initiatives.

cover letter:

I am writing to express my interest in a Product and Technology leadership role within your organization. With over a decade of experience spanning product management, engineering leadership, and data-driven platforms across startups and large organizations, I bring a strong track record of delivering complex systems and scaling products in challenging environments.


Most recently, I served as VP of Product and Technology at Manuva, where I led cross-functional product, engineering, design, and data teams to build and scale an integrated manufacturing and supply platform serving both B2B and B2R customers. Prior to that, I held senior product leadership roles at Finantier, RedDoorz, and Payfazz, where I owned product strategy, roadmap execution, and delivery for high-impact platforms in fintech and consumer technology.

One of the most complex systems I helped deliver was a global data platform for WWF, which aggregated large-scale datasets from dozens of national organizations worldwide. The platform combined Python-based data pipelines, GIS visualization, and analytics to support global decision-making. This experience strengthened my ability to manage technical complexity, data quality challenges, and stakeholder alignment across regions.

Throughout my career, I have frequently navigated difficult tradeoffs between speed, stability, and long-term scalability—particularly during periods of market uncertainty, regulatory constraints, and organizational change. I am comfortable adapting plans when execution or technical realities require it, while keeping teams focused on delivering measurable business value.

I am motivated by opportunities where technology, data, and product strategy intersect to solve meaningful problems. I believe my experience building 0-to-1 products, scaling platforms, and leading multidisciplinary teams would allow me to contribute effectively to your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs.
